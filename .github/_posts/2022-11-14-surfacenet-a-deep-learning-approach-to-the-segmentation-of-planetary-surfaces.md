*Abstract* — SurfaceNet is a machine learning based solution to the segmentation of planetary surfaces. As mankind continues to explore planets in our solar system, data in the form of planetary surface maps plays a crucial role in the decision-making process. The segmentation of the terrain extracted from planetary surface maps is a necessity for researchers to conduct studies on the planet. However, the current method of segmentation is manual (up to human interpretation), which results in inaccuracy and slow speeds. SurfaceNet employs deep convolutional neural networks and markov random fields to first classify, then segment planetary terrain. Utilizing public Mars CTX (Nasa’s Context Camera Telescope) imaging data, the model’s hyperparameters were tuned to best fit the data and automate the creation of surface maps. Even though the preliminary results are still being collected, the application of modern-day machine learning algorithms has been proven to produce reliable and robust results. Data on the geological aspects of planets is vital for researchers to determine their habitability, climate, and helps in mankind’s preparation for further exploration. Integrating this framework in current research would greatly reduce time and inaccuracy in the process of segmenting planetary terrain.
