#### Millburn High School


I am a student at Millburn High School studying machine learning and data compression. My research interests include computer vision for segmenting 
surfaces of mars to creating novel video compression algorithms.

I am currently the **Co-President** of the AI Initiative at Millburn High School, **Co-Captain** of VEX Robotics Team [7405N](https://millburnrobotics.org/teams/7405N), and one of the **leaders** of [EssexIQ](https://essexiq.com/).
